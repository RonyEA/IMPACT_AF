```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE)
```

## Overview

This guide explains how to **install and initialize the IMPACTaf model** from GitHub. It will walk through setting up dependencies and installing the internal R package used by the model.

---

## Step 1: Clone or Download the Repository

You can either:

- Clone the repo:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/RonyEA/IMPACT_AF.git
  ```

- Or download the `.zip`:
  - Click **Code > Download ZIP**
  - Extract it to a folder on your local machine

---

## Step 2: Set the Working Directory

In R or RStudio, set your working directory to the project folder:

```r
setwd("/path/to/IMPACTaf")  # Replace with your local path
```

> This is required to ensure file paths in `global.R` are correctly resolved.

---

## Step 3: Run the Global Initialization Script

Once you're in the project directory, run:

```r
source("global.R")
```

This will:

- Install required dependencies listed in `dependencies.yaml`
- Install the `IMPACTaf_model_pkg` package using `remotes::install_local()`
- Regenerate documentation via `roxygen2`
- Cache a snapshot to avoid reinstallation if no changes are detected

> ⚠️ Internet connection is required the first time to download the packages and it's dependencies.

---

## Check Installed Package

After running `global.R`, load and check that the package is ready:

```r
library(IMPACTaf)

?TransitionModel  # View documentation for the core class
```

## ✅ Summary

| Task | Command |
|------|---------|
| Set working directory | `setwd("/your/path/IMPACT_AF")` |
| Install and build the model | `source("global.R")` |
| Load the package | `library(IMPACTaf)` |

You're now ready to simulate health state transitions and run scenarios!
